# fGOT

This is the code accompanying the AAAI 2022 paper "fGOT: Graph Distances based on Filters and Optimal Transport".

The main algorithms are contained in files fgot_mgd.py and fgot_stochastic_mgd.py. An example on using the algorithms can be found in the jupyter notebook speed_alignment_test.
    
Some of the files in this code have been taken from the Python OT library (https://github.com/PythonOT/POT).
