# fGOT

This is the code accompanying the AAAI 2022 paper "fGOT: Graph Distances based on Filters and Optimal Transport".

The main algorithms are contained in files fgot_mgd.py and fgot_stochastic_mgd.py. An example on using the algorithms can be found in the jupyter notebook speed_alignment_test.
